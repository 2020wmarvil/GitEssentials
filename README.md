# GitEssentials

This repo is the workshop template for my [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FTG0przG_hqvTGzeJ8M_xlHlImwCXFq3gZoRlH11bFE/edit?usp=sharing) on the essentials of Git, specifically in the context of developing for Unity. 

This workshop was designed as a 30 minute interactive exercise to help familiarize my team at [Knucklebones Interactive](https://www.knucklebones.us/interactive) with the basic operations necessary to collaborate on a project and avoid conflicts.
